# Simple User Management Web Service

A RESTful web service implemented using Spring Boot based on Chapter 3 of the online
course [Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud](https://links.in28minutes.com/microservices)
by In28Minutes (via O'Reilly).

Changes/additions made to the course materials:

* Added unit tests with 98% coverage for each change sets.
* Supported YAML as request body content-type and enabled Swagger UI to accept YAML payload.
* Used Lombok and Java features such as record and steam to reduce boilerplate.
* Enabled code formatter, Checkstyle and SonarLint to enforce code quality.
